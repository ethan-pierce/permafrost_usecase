# Data Component Use Case for Permafrost Processes

Permafrost is defined as any material (rock or soil) that remains below 0Â°C for two or more consecutive years. This repo
includes a [Jupyter Notebook](permafrost_alaska.ipynb) 
to demonstrate how to use several [CSDMS data components](https://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/DataComponents) to download 
topography, snow and temperature data to calculate the permafrost active layer thickness 
and simulate the hillslope diffusion process for a study area in Alaska.

If you have any suggestion to improve this notebook, please create a github issue 
[here](https://github.com/gantian127/permafrost_usecase/issues).
